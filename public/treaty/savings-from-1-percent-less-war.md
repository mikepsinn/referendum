## Cumulative Savings from Decreased Annual Cost of War

Given the initial annual cost of war is approximately $7,238.25 billion, we explore the scenario where this cost decreases by 1% every year for 80 years. This decrease reflects potential efficiencies, peacekeeping successes, and the reallocation of resources towards more productive and peaceful endeavors. Here's how the calculations unfold:

## Assumptions for Cumulative Reduced War Costs Calculation:

- **Initial Annual Cost of War:** $7,238.25 billion.
- **Annual Decrease Rate:** 1% per year.
- **Duration:** 80 years.
- **Global Population:** 7.8 billion.

## 80 Year Cumulative Reduced War Cost Calculations:

1. **Total Cost with Decrease:** We calculate the total cost over 80 years, taking into account the 1% annual decrease. This involves summing up the cost for each year, where each subsequent year's cost is 1% less than the previous year's.

2. **Total Cost without Decrease:** For comparison, we calculate what the total cost would have been if it remained constant at $7,238.25 billion per year over 80 years.

3. **Cumulative Savings:** The difference between the total cost without the decrease and the total cost with the decrease gives us the cumulative savings over 80 years.

4. **Per Capita Savings:** To determine the impact on an individual level, we divide the cumulative savings by the global population of 7.8 billion.

## 80 Year Cumulative Reduced War Costs:

- **Cumulative Savings:** $179.16 trillion
- **Per Capita Savings:** $22,969.68 per person

By reducing the annual cost of war by a modest 1% annually over the course of 80 years, the global community could save $179 trillion, translating to almost $23,000 in savings per person.
