#### Calculating the ROI

The return on investment (ROI) for lobbying efforts is calculated using the formula: 

ROI = ( Benefit ‚àí Cost ) / Cost √ó 100

Applying this formula:

- **Lower Estimate**: With a lobbying cost of $200 million and benefits of $800 billion from contracts, the ROI calculates to approximately 399,900%.
- **Higher Estimate**: With a lobbying cost of $300 million and benefits of $1 trillion, the ROI is approximately 333,233.33%.
