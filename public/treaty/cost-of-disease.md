# Global Cost Of Disease

The **$244 trillion** annual total global cost of disease is a comprehensive measure that encompasses direct healthcare costs, indirect economic losses, and the $100k valuation of a Year of Life Lost (YLL) and a $100k valuation Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALYs). 

## Direct Healthcare Costs

- **Direct Annual Healthcare Expenditures:** $8.5 trillion, representing the cost of medical treatments, medications, hospital stays, and other healthcare services.

## Indirect Economic Losses

- **Indirect Annual Economic Losses:** $4.7 trillion, reflecting the broader economic impact of diseases on productivity and output.

## Economic Valuation of YLL and DALYs

The value assigned to a Year of Life Lost (YLL) and a Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY) can vary significantly depending on the context, purpose of the valuation, and the economic framework applied. These values are used in health economics to inform public health policy, prioritize healthcare interventions, and allocate resources efficiently. The methodology and the specific value can differ by country, healthcare system, and the economic conditions of the area under consideration.

### Value of a YLL

The value of a YLL typically reflects the economic loss associated with premature mortality. This can be based on potential future earnings lost due to early death or the willingness to pay to reduce the risk of dying prematurely. The approach can vary:

- **Human Capital Approach:** Often calculates lost future earnings, sometimes adjusted for factors like expected work-life years remaining and productivity growth rates.
- **Value of Statistical Life (VSL):** Based on individuals' willingness to pay for marginal reductions in their risk of dying. VSL is widely used in policy settings and can vary greatly between countries and within countries over time, often ranging from a few million to tens of millions of dollars.

### Value of a DALY

The value of a DALY attempts to quantify the burden of both morbidity and mortality. It integrates the value of life years lost due to premature death and the value of life years lived with disability. Valuing a DALY can follow similar principles to valuing a YLL but also considers the costs and quality of life associated with living with disabilities and diseases. Like YLL, the valuation methods can include:

- **Cost of Illness (COI):** Incorporates direct medical costs, indirect costs like lost productivity, and sometimes intangible costs related to pain and suffering.
- **Willingness to Pay (WTP):** Estimates based on how much individuals are willing to pay for interventions that reduce the risk of illness or disability.

### Typical Values

While specific monetary values can vary widely, a common approach in international health policy analysis is to value a DALY at 1 to 3 times the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita of a country. This approach provides a benchmark that adjusts for the economic conditions of the country. For instance, in a country with a GDP per capita of $50,000, a DALY might be valued between $50,000 and $150,000.


### Economic Valuation of Excess Mortality (YLL)

To monetize YLL, we adopt a conservative value that reflects the economic loss due to premature mortality. Assuming an average income approach or a statistical value of life approach, we might assign a figure like $100,000 per YLL. If we base our calculation on the WHO's reported 63 million excess deaths annually:

- **YLL Economic Valuation:** $100,000 per YLL * YLLs (calculated from 63 million excess deaths with an average YLL estimate per death).

### Economic Valuation of Morbidity and Disability (DALYs)

For DALYs, which combine YLL with Years Lived with Disability (YLD), we use a similar valuation approach. Assigning a value to each DALY reflects the cost of both premature death and living with disability. Assuming $100,000 per DALY as a conservative estimate:

- **DALY Economic Valuation:** $100,000 per DALY * 1.68 billion DALYs.

## Total Annual Economic Impact: Calculations

For YLL, assuming an average of 10 years lost per death, and for DALYs, directly applying the $100,000 valuation:

1. **YLL Economic Impact:** Assuming 63 million excess deaths and an average YLL per death, with a specific valuation per YLL.
2. **DALY Economic Impact:** 1.68 billion DALYs valued at $100,000 each.

These calculations provide us with a monetary estimate of the total global burden of disease, incorporating both health outcomes and direct plus indirect economic losses. 

The calculations incorporating economic valuations for Years of Life Lost (YLL) and Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) yield the following insights into the global disease burden:

- **Economic Impact of Excess Mortality (YLL):** $63 trillion, based on the valuation of years of life lost due to premature mortality.
- **Economic Impact of Morbidity and Disability (DALYs):** $168 trillion, reflecting the combined cost of premature death and living with disability.

This leads to a **Total Annual Economic Impact** of the global disease burden of approximately $244.2 trillion. This total encompasses:

- Direct Healthcare Costs: $8.5 trillion
- Indirect Economic Losses: $4.7 trillion
- Economic Valuation of YLL: $63 trillion
- Economic Valuation of DALYs: $168 trillion
