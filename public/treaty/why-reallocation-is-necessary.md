### Military Spending vs. Health Research: A Brain Drain

When we talk about where our money goes, especially the big budgets like what's spent on the military, it's like choosing between two futures. One future focuses on weapons and wars, which can lead to destruction and loss of lives. The other invests in health research, aiming to cure diseases and help us live longer, healthier lives.

### The Competition in Health Research

Imagine you're passionate about helping people live longer, so you start a nonprofit focused on longevity, which means studying how we can extend our healthy years. You're not alone; many groups share your mission. But here's the catch:

- **Scarce Funding**: There's only so much money to go around for health research. Every new group that pops up is competing for the same limited pot of funds.
- **The Funding Pie**: Think of funding as a pie. Starting another longevity nonprofit or company doesn't make the pie bigger; it just divides it into more, smaller pieces.
- **Efficiency Questions**: If you manage to get funding, how do you know your group will use it better than another group might have?

### Increasing the Funding Pie

So, how do we make the pie bigger instead of just slicing it thinner? The answer lies in looking at where a huge chunk of our collective budget goes: military spending.

- **Shifting Resources**: By [reallocating even a small fraction](logical-treaty.md) of the money spent on the military to health research, we can significantly increase the funds available for medical breakthroughs.
- **From Destructive to Constructive**: Military budgets are massive globally. This spending is at the expense of constructive areas like health research. By shifting some of those funds, we're moving from investing in means of destruction to investing in life-saving research.

### Conclusion: A Choice Between Futures

The decision to reallocate funds from military spending to health research is essentially a choice between two paths. One path takes us to a world populated by the remaining slaughterbots after all humans have been destroyed, while the other invests in our collective well-being and future health. It's about prioritizing life and longevity over destruction. This isn't just about making more money available for health research; it's about choosing a future where we value improving and saving lives more than the capacity to destroy them.
