# LOGICAL Treaty

## Facts:

1. **2 billion people suffer** from chronic diseases including cancer, diabetes, heart disease, autoimmune disorders, and many others. This causes immense human anguish as well as crippling economic costs.
2. **Medical research** to find cures for these diseases remains far **too slow** to meet the desperate needs of patients.
3. **Artificial intelligence** can radically accelerate the clinical research process by **automating **analysis of medical data, identifying promising drug targets, optimizing clinical trial designs, and more.
4. A global collaborative effort to deploy AI to automate clinical research, coordinated and governed by the people, could produce revolutionary breakthroughs against chronic diseases and **alleviate the suffering of billions of people.**

## Logical Proof:

Here is the logical proof that signing this accord is the most rational thing you can do with the next few moments of your life:

1. Governments currently spend over $2 trillion per year on their militaries. They don’t do this because they like blowing up other people and their stuff. They do this to maintain the balance of power against other nations that might blow them up.

2. However, if every nation agreed to reallocate just 1% of their annual military expenditures to a global medical research fund:

  * The relative balance of power would remain unchanged. So, despite spending less on the military, they would be at no greater relative risk of being murdered by another country.
  * The entire world would benefit from the resulting health advances and cures for diseases.

3. Therefore, it is clearly in your rational self-interest to sign this treaty requesting that all nations to cooperate in this endeavor. By contributing a infinitesimal portion of their military budgets, they can help unlock revolutionary health benefits for their own citizens and the world at large.

## How it Works:

1. Every participating nation will pledge **1% of its annual military budget** to the [Decentralized Institutes of Health (DIH)](decentralized-institues-of-health.md). For example, if global military spending is $2 trillion per year, this would create a $20 billion annual fund. Participation from all nations is essential to maintain geopolitical stability.
2. The **fund will support AI-driven research projects** aimed at discovering new treatments, cures, and early-detection methods for cancer, heart disease, diabetes, Alzheimer’s, and other chronic diseases that take the heaviest toll on human health worldwide.
3. Research institutions, medical centers, and AI labs around the world will be invited to **submit project proposals** to the fund. These proposals will be reviewed and ranked by a global panel of experts based on their scientific merit, feasibility, and potential impact.
4. However, the final decision on which projects receive funding will be [**made democratically**](decentralized-institues-of-health.md) by the global public. Using a [crowdfunding platform](decentralized-institues-of-health.md), anyone in the world will be able to vote on the proposals they believe hold the most promise. This crowdsourced approach ensures that the fund remains accountable to the people and focused on the projects that matter most to them.
5. All research findings and data generated through the fund will be made openly available in real-time to the global scientific community, **accelerating progress** and enabling rapid translation of discoveries into new medicines and improved clinical practices worldwide.
6. Participating nations and research institutions will collaborate continuously through a state-of-the-art online platform, sharing knowledge, best practices, and resources to **maximize the impact of every research dollar** and speed the deployment of new health solutions to patients everywhere.

By combining the power of AI, the resources of global crowdfunding, and the collective wisdom of the world’s people, we can transform the fight against chronic disease. The resulting breakthroughs will improve health, extend lives, boost economies, and benefit every nation on Earth.

# Cost of War

The direct and indirect costs of war come out to [$74,259](cost-of-war.md) per person over an 80-year lifespan.

# Cumulative Savings from Decreased Annual Cost of War

Reducing spending on war by 1% annually would reduce the per-person costs by [$22,969](savings-from-1-percent-less-war.md) over an 80-year lifespan.

# Cost of Disease

The [**$244 trillion**](cost-of-disease.md) total global annual cost of disease is a comprehensive measure that encompasses direct healthcare costs, indirect economic losses, and the $100k valuation of a Year of Life Lost (YLL) and a $100k valuation Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALYs).

# Redirecting 1% of Military Spending to Healthcare Innovation

 By redirecting just 1% of war spending each year to using AI to automate clinical research and personalized, preventive, precision medicine over 80 years, we would save lives, reduce disability, and significantly impact the global economy.  The monetary benefit of this shift would be approximately [$1,235,443](value-of-automating-research.md) per person over 80 years.

# Total Net Benefit of Less War and More Cures

The total combined per capita net benefit of redirecting 1% of military spending to healthcare innovation over 80 years would be [$1,258,412](value-of-automating-research.md). 

This is calculated by adding the [$22,969](savings-from-1-percent-less-war.md) savings from decreased annual cost of war to the [$1,235,443](value-of-automating-research.md) benefit of reducing the burden of chronic disease.

# $1,258,412 for 5 Hours of Your Time

Historical examples show that petitions with support from over **1% of the population** have a high likelihood of being adopted. 

So all you have to do is convince a small fraction of your friends to sign this treaty and convince them to convince a small fraction of their friends to sign this treaty and so on.

Given the average number of friends (150) and the estimated time per friend (2 minutes), an average person would need to invest approximately [5 hours](individual-roi.md) to individually reach out to all 150 of their friends via personal messages or emails about the treaty.
