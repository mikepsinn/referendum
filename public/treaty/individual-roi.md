# Individual ROI on Getting Friends to Sign the Treaty

$1,258,412 for 5 Hours of Your Time

Historical examples show that petitions with support from over **1% of the population** have a high likelihood of being adopted.

So all you have to do is convince a small fraction of your friends to sign this treaty and convince them to convince a small fraction of their friends to sign this treaty and so on.

## Factors Influencing Time Investment

1. **Number of Friends:** The average number of significant relationships one might actively maintain, often cited as Dunbar's number, is around 150.

2. **Method of Communication:** Personal messages or emails are considered for this estimation, assuming they strike a balance between personal touch and efficiency.

3. **Time Per Friend:** It's estimated that drafting and sending a personal message or email would take approximately 2 minutes per friend. This includes the time to write the message and possibly tailor it slightly for each friend.

## Calculation

Given the average number of friends (150) and the estimated time per friend (2 minutes), the total time investment can be calculated as follows:

- **Total Friends:** 150
- **Time per Friend:** 2 minutes

Total Time = Number of Friends × Time per Friend
= 150 friends × 2 minutes/friend
= 300 minutes

Converting this into hours:

Total Time in Hours = Total Time in Minutes / 60
= 300 minutes / 60
= 5 hours

Based on this estimation, an average person would need to invest approximately 5 hours to individually reach out to all 150 of their friends via personal messages or emails about the treaty. This calculation assumes a brief but personalized communication method, emphasizing the importance of each conversation in promoting global initiatives.
